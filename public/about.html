    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      My passion is health and fitness. I love to lift weights, run, and play many sports, including 
      pickleball, volleyball, and soccer. I also really enjoy rock-climbing, long-boarding, and country 
      swing dancing.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Much of my current skill-set comes from the construction industry. I worked as a roofer for 6 months,
      then as a fence construction laborer for 3 years. That particular job enabled me to learn how to operate 
      heavy machinery, learn basic welding, and how to use many other power and non-power tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that time, I was also gaining basic home repair skills, as I am also involved in real estate 
      investing. I have 1 rental, and have bought and sold two other properties, with plans to do more fix-and-
      flip deals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also fluent in Mandarin Chinese. I spent 2 years in Taiwan as a missionary, and the 5 months in 
      Southern China after that.
